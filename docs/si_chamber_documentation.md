# Spark Ignition (SI) Combustion Chamber Documentation

## Overview
The Spark Ignition (SI) combustion chamber is a traditional design used in gasoline engines where a spark plug initiates combustion of a premixed air-fuel mixture. This document describes the geometry, mixture formation, ignition mechanism, and performance characteristics based on simulation data.

## Chamber Geometry
The SI chamber features a pent-roof design with centrally located spark plug and intake/exhaust valves positioned on opposite sides. Key geometric parameters include:
- **Compression Ratio:** 10.5:1
- **Bore:** 86 mm
- **Stroke:** 86 mm
- **Squish Area:** 15% of piston crown area
- **Volume at Top Dead Center (TDC):** 55 cm³

The shape promotes rapid flame propagation and minimizes knocking tendency by providing adequate turbulence and swirl.

## Fuel-Air Mixture Formation
Mixture preparation occurs in the intake port and manifold:
- **Air‑fuel ratio (λ):** 1.0 (stoichiometric) for maximum power and three‑way catalyst efficiency.
- **Mixture homogeneity:** High homogeneity due to port‑fuel injection and intake‑manifold mixing.
- **Charge motion:** Induced swirl (tumble) improves flame speed and combustion stability.

The simulation input file (`designs/si/simulation_input.json`) defines injection timing, duration, and injector positioning to achieve the desired mixture distribution.

## Ignition Mechanism
Ignition is triggered by a high‑voltage spark discharge across the electrodes of a spark plug:
- **Spark timing:** 15° before top dead center (BTDC) at full load.
- **Spark energy:** 50 mJ per discharge.
- **Flame kernel development:** The initial kernel grows into a self‑sustaining spherical flame front that propagates through the chamber.

The spark‑plug gap, electrode geometry, and coil characteristics are selected to ensure reliable ignition under all operating conditions.

## Combustion Process
Once ignited, the flame front travels outward from the spark plug, consuming the premixed charge. The pressure‑rise rate is controlled by the flame speed, which depends on:
- **Turbulence intensity** (generated by intake swirl and squish)
- **Mixture temperature and pressure**
- **Residual gas fraction**

The simulated pressure‑volume (P‑V) diagram (see `designs/si/performance_plot.png`) shows a typical Otto‑cycle loop with rapid pressure rise after ignition and smooth expansion.

## Performance Characteristics (from Simulation)
The following performance metrics are extracted from the simulation output:
- **Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP):** 9.8 bar at 2500 rpm, wide‑open throttle.
- **Thermal efficiency:** 32% (indicated) at the same operating point.
- **Combustion duration (10–90% mass burned):** 25 °CA.
- **Peak cylinder pressure:** 45 bar at 15° after TDC.

These values are consistent with a modern, naturally‑aspirated SI engine optimized for passenger‑car applications.

## Emissions (Simulated)
Emissions data (`designs/si/emissions_data.csv`) indicate the following trends:
- **NOx:** 1.2 g/kWh – moderate levels due to stoichiometric combustion and relatively low peak temperatures (compared to diesel).
- **CO:** 5.8 g/kWh – primarily formed in rich regions and during incomplete combustion.
- **Unburnt hydrocarbons (HC):** 0.9 g/kWh – result of flame quenching near walls and crevice volumes.

## Design Considerations
- **Spark‑plug location** is critical for minimizing flame‑travel distance and cycle‑to‑cycle variation.
- **Squish and swirl** enhance turbulence, speeding up combustion and improving tolerance to dilute mixtures (EGR).
- **Crevice volumes** (piston‑ring lands, head‑gasket gaps) should be minimized to reduce HC emissions.
- **Cooling** of the chamber walls must be sufficient to avoid knock while maintaining good thermal efficiency.

## Conclusion
The SI combustion chamber offers a well‑understood, robust solution for gasoline engines, delivering good power output and acceptable emissions when operated with a three‑way catalyst. Its performance is heavily influenced by geometric details, mixture preparation, and ignition timing, all of which can be optimized through simulation.
